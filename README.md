# T2-Project

This repo will contain the classes and functionality to produce a 2D RPG game, that has the following:

* A health bar
* Different character classes
* Skills
* Levelling, which will reward the player with attribute points to spend on increasing certain attributes
* A world map, that may have sublevels or be a big mess of stuff, kinda like a sandbox (kinda like Minecraft)
* The ability to add more to what was already created with ease

## What have I done so far:

I haven't done much to doing the above, but I am creating the framework to implement what was listed above.
I do have inspiration for what it might look like, but implementation details are subject to change.

Currently, the list is:

Nothing. I haven't actually built a working framework yet (but I am close)
